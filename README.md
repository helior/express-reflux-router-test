### Installation
From project root, run `npm install`

## Running Server
From project root, run `node server.js`

## Webpack
From project root, run `webpack`

## Run on the browser
Ensure you build `bundle.js` with webpack first; `cd` into the `dist` directory and initiate a local server (I use `php -S localhost:8000`)
